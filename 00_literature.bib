  abstract = {It is well known that the hydrodynamics of a zero-temperature superfluid can be formulated in field-theoretic terms, relating for example the superfluid four-velocity to the gradient of the phase of a Bose-condensed scalar field. At nonzero temperatures, where the phenomenology of a superfluid is usually described within a two-fluid picture, this relationship is less obvious. For the case of a uniform, dissipationless superfluid at small temperatures and weak coupling we discuss this relationship within a phi{\textasciicircum}4 model. For instance, we compute the entrainment coefficient, which describes the interaction between the superfluid and the normal-fluid components, and the velocities of first and second sound in the presence of a superflow. Our study is very general, but can also be seen as a step towards understanding the superfluid properties of various phases of dense nuclear and quark matter in the interior of compact stars.},

  abstract = {The ALICE experiment was proposed in 1993, to study strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities via a comprehensive investigation of nuclear collisions at the LHC. Its physics programme initially focused on the determination of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of quarks and gluons and was extended along the years, covering a diverse ensemble of observables related to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. The experiment has studied Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, p-Pb and pp collisions in the multi-TeV energy range, during the Run 1 and Run 2 data taking periods at the LHC (2009-2018). The aim of this review article is to gather and summarise a selection of ALICE physics results and to discuss their implications on the current understanding of the macroscopic and microscopic properties of strongly interacting matter at the highest temperature reached in the laboratory. It will be shown that it is possible to have a quantitative description of the properties of the QGP produced in Pb--Pb collisions. We also show that various features, commonly ascribed to QGP formation, are detected for a wide range of interacting system sizes. Precision measurements of QCD-related observables not directly connected to the study of the QGP will also be discussed. Prospects for future measurements with the ALICE detector and its foreseen upgrades will also be briefly described.},

We give an accessible introduction to how to study this smallest and hottest droplet of liquid made on Earth and why it is so interesting. The physics of heavy ion collisions ranges from highly energetic quarks and gluons described by perturbative QCD to a bath of strongly interacting gluons at lower energy scales. These gluons quickly thermalize and form QGP, while the energetic partons traverse this plasma and end in a shower of particles called jets. Analyzing the final particles in various ways allows us to study the properties of QGP and the complex dynamics of multiscale processes in QCD that govern its formation and evolution, providing what is perhaps the simplest form of complex quantum matter that we know of. Much remains to be understood, and throughout the review big open questions are encountered.},

We present a study of standard Boltzmann-Gibbs blast-wave (BGBW) fits and Tsallis blast-wave (TBW) fits performed on the transverse momentum spectra of identified hadrons produced in Au+Au collisions at collision energies of {\textsurd}sNN=7.7--200 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and in Pb+Pb collisions at collision energies of {\textsurd}sNN=2.76 and 5.02 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The behavior of strange and multistrange particles is also investigated. We found that the TBW model describes data better than the BGBW one overall, and the contrast is more prominent as the collision energy increases as the degree of nonequilibrium of the produced system is found to increase. From TBW fits, the kinetic freeze-out temperature at the same centrality shows a weak dependence of collision energy between 7.7 and 39 GeV, while it decreases as collision energy continues to increase up to 5.02 TeV. The radial flow is found to be consistent with zero in peripheral collisions at RHIC energies but sizable at LHC energies and central collisions at all RHIC energies. We also observed that the strange hadrons, with higher temperature and similar radial flow, approach equilibrium more quickly from peripheral to central collisions than light hadrons. The dependence of temperature and flow velocity on nonequilibrium parameter (q-1) is characterized by two second-order polynomials. Both a and d{$\xi$} from the polynomials fit, related to the influence of the system bulk viscosity, increase toward lower RHIC energies.},

In our scenario, rapid initial heating of the parton system provides a driving force for the chiral field, moving it away from the true vacuum and forcing it to go to the opposite point on the vacuum manifold. This converts the entire hot region into a single DCC domain. Subsequent rolling down of the chiral field to its true vacuum will then lead to emission of a large number of (approximately) coherent pions. The requirement of suppression of thermal fluctuations to maintain the (approximate) coherence of such a large DCC domain, favors three dimensional expansion of the plasma over the longitudinal expansion even at very early stages of evolution. This also constrains the maximum temperature of the system to lie within a window. We roughly estimate this window to be about 200 - 400 MeV. These results lead us to predict that extremely high energy collisions of \{{\textbackslash}it very small nuclei\} (possibly hadrons) are better suited for observing signatures of a large DCC. Another possibility is to focus on \{{\textbackslash}it peripheral\} collisions of heavy nuclei.},

In this paper, a cosmological model is proposed in which dark energy (DE) is identified with the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of some boson field. The global cosmic acceleration caused by this BEC and multiple rapid collapses of BEC into black holes and other forms of localized matter [= dark matter (DM)] are examined on the basis of the relativistic version of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We propose (a) a novel mechanism of inflation, free from the slow-rolling condition, (b) a natural solution to the cosmic coincidence (`Why now?') problem through the transition from DE to DM, (c) very early formation of highly non-linear objects, such as black holes, which might have triggered the first light as a form of quasars, and (d) log-z periodicity in the subsequent BEC collapsing time. All of these are based on a steady, slow BEC process.},

Comparing with previous work where the q-qbar mesons are identified with the nonet at 1200-1700 MeV, we find that the mixing required to fit the mass spectrum is in good agreement with the instanton coupling obtained from light scalar decays. A coherent picture of scalar mesons as a mixture of tetraquark states (dominating in the lightest mesons) and heavy q-qbar states (dominating in the heavier mesons) emerges.},

We provide explicit expressions for the integration over the freeze-out surface for a smooth and symmetric background solution, as well as for linearized perturbations around it. A major advantage of our method is that many integrals can be precomputed independently of a concrete hydrodynamic simulation. Additionally, we examine the influence of adding heavier resonances to the decay chain on the spectrum of pions and show how to include a phase with partial chemical equilibrium in order to separate the chemical from the kinetic freeze-out.},

Starting at a temperature above the phase transition, the system expands and cools, finally settling into the broken symmetry vacuum state. We consider the proper time evolution of the effective pion mass, the order parameter {\textlangle}{$\sigma\rangle$}, and the particle number distribution. We examine several different initial conditions and look for instabilities (exponentially growing long wavelength modes) which can lead to the formation of disoriented chiral condensates (DCC's). We find that instabilities exist for proper times which are less than 3 fm/c. We also show that an experimental signature of domain growth is an increase in the low momentum spectrum of outgoing pions when compared to an expansion in thermal equilibrium. In comparison to particle production during a longitudinal expansion, we find that in a spherical expansion the system reaches the "out" regime much faster and more particles get produced. However the size of the unstable region, which is related to the domain size of DCC's, is not enhanced.},

The method is based on identifying components of the final particle spectrum that transform in an irreducible way under rotations in the fluid-restframe. Corresponding distribution functions can be pre-computed including all resonance decays. Just a few of easily tabulated scalar functions then determine the Lorentz invariant decay spectrum from each space-time point, and simple integrals of these scalar functions over the freeze-out surface determine the final decay products. This by-passes numerically costly event-by-event calculations of the intermediate resonances. The method is of considerable practical use for making realistic data to model comparisons of the identified particle yields and flow harmonics, and for studying the viscous corrections to the freeze-out distribution function.},
