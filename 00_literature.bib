  abstract = {In this work the nature of the {\textbackslash}sigma or f\_0(600) resonance is discussed by evaluating its quadratic scalar radius, {\textbackslash}la r{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}ra\_s{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}sigma. This allows one to have a quantitative estimate for the size of this resonance. We obtain that the {\textbackslash}sigma resonance is a compact object with \${\textbackslash}la r{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}ra\_s{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}sigma=(0.19{\textbackslash}pm0.02)-i(0.06{\textbackslash}pm0.02)\$ fm{\textasciicircum}2. Within our approach, employing unitary chiral perturbation theory, the {\textbackslash}sigma is a dynamically generated resonance that stems from the pion-pion interactions. Given its small size we conclude that the two pions inside the resonance are merged. A four-quark picture is then more appropriate. However, when the pion mass increases, for pion masses somewhat above 400 MeV, the picture of a two-pion molecule is the appropriate one. The {\textbackslash}sigma is then a spread {\textbackslash}pi{\textbackslash}pi bound state. These results are connected with other recent works that support a non standard nature of the {\textbackslash}sigma as well, while fulfilling strong QCD constraints, as well as with lattice QCD. We offer a detailed study of the low-energy S-wave {\textbackslash}pi{\textbackslash}pi scattering data from where we extract our values for the threshold parameters of S-wave {\textbackslash}pi{\textbackslash}pi phase shifts, the \{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(p{\textasciicircum}4) chiral perturbation theory low energy constants as well as the {\textbackslash}sigma pole position. From the comparison with other accurate determinations in the literature we obtain the average values for the isospin 0 S-wave {\textbackslash}pi{\textbackslash}pi threshold parameters, \$a\_0{\textasciicircum}0=0.220{\textbackslash}pm0.003\$, \$b\_0{\textasciicircum}0=0.279{\textbackslash}pm 0.003 M\_{\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, and for the real and imaginary parts of the {\textbackslash}sigma pole position in {\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}, \$458{\textbackslash}pm14-i(261{\textbackslash}pm17)\$ MeV. The quark mass dependence of the size of the {\textbackslash}sigma, its mass and width are considered too. The latter agree accurately with a previous lattice QCD calculation. The fact that the mass of this resonance tends to follow the threshold of two pions is a clear indication that the {\textbackslash}sigma is a dynamically generated meson-meson resonance.},

At nonzero temperatures, where the phenomenology of a superfluid is usually described within a two-fluid picture, this relationship is less obvious. For the case of a uniform, dissipationless superfluid at small temperatures and weak coupling we discuss this relationship within a phi{\textasciicircum}4 model. For instance, we compute the entrainment coefficient, which describes the interaction between the superfluid and the normal-fluid components, and the velocities of first and second sound in the presence of a superflow. Our study is very general, but can also be seen as a step towards understanding the superfluid properties of various phases of dense nuclear and quark matter in the interior of compact stars.},

  abstract = {The ALICE experiment was proposed in 1993, to study strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities via a comprehensive investigation of nuclear collisions at the LHC. Its physics programme initially focused on the determination of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of quarks and gluons and was extended along the years, covering a diverse ensemble of observables related to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. The experiment has studied Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, p-Pb and pp collisions in the multi-TeV energy range, during the Run 1 and Run 2 data taking periods at the LHC (2009-2018). The aim of this review article is to gather and summarise a selection of ALICE physics results and to discuss their implications on the current understanding of the macroscopic and microscopic properties of strongly interacting matter at the highest temperature reached in the laboratory. It will be shown that it is possible to have a quantitative description of the properties of the QGP produced in Pb--Pb collisions. We also show that various features, commonly ascribed to QGP formation, are detected for a wide range of interacting system sizes. Precision measurements of QCD-related observables not directly connected to the study of the QGP will also be discussed. Prospects for future measurements with the ALICE detector and its foreseen upgrades will also be briefly described.},

These gluons quickly thermalize and form QGP, while the energetic partons traverse this plasma and end in a shower of particles called jets. Analyzing the final particles in various ways allows us to study the properties of QGP and the complex dynamics of multiscale processes in QCD that govern its formation and evolution, providing what is perhaps the simplest form of complex quantum matter that we know of.

The behavior of strange and multistrange particles is also investigated. We found that the TBW model describes data better than the BGBW one overall, and the contrast is more prominent as the collision energy increases as the degree of nonequilibrium of the produced system is found to increase. From TBW fits, the kinetic freeze-out temperature at the same centrality shows a weak dependence of collision energy between 7.7 and 39 GeV, while it decreases as collision energy continues to increase up to 5.02 TeV. The radial flow is found to be consistent with zero in peripheral collisions at RHIC energies but sizable at LHC energies and central collisions at all RHIC energies. We also observed that the strange hadrons, with higher temperature and similar radial flow, approach equilibrium more quickly from peripheral to central collisions than light hadrons. The dependence of temperature and flow velocity on nonequilibrium parameter (q-1) is characterized by two second-order polynomials. Both a and d{$\xi$} from the polynomials fit, related to the influence of the system bulk viscosity, increase toward lower RHIC energies.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the possibility of forming a single, large domain of disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) in a heavy-ion collision. In our scenario, rapid initial heating of the parton system provides a driving force for the chiral field, moving it away from the true vacuum and forcing it to go to the opposite point on the vacuum manifold. This converts the entire hot region into a single DCC domain. Subsequent rolling down of the chiral field to its true vacuum will then lead to emission of a large number of (approximately) coherent pions. The requirement of suppression of thermal fluctuations to maintain the (approximate) coherence of such a large DCC domain, favors three dimensional expansion of the plasma over the longitudinal expansion even at very early stages of evolution. This also constrains the maximum temperature of the system to lie within a window. We roughly estimate this window to be about 200 - 400 MeV. These results lead us to predict that extremely high energy collisions of \{{\textbackslash}it very small nuclei\} (possibly hadrons) are better suited for observing signatures of a large DCC. Another possibility is to focus on \{{\textbackslash}it peripheral\} collisions of heavy nuclei.},

Comparing with previous work where the q-qbar mesons are identified with the nonet at 1200-1700 MeV, we find that the mixing required to fit the mass spectrum is in good agreement with the instanton coupling obtained from light scalar decays. A coherent picture of scalar mesons as a mixture of tetraquark states (dominating in the lightest mesons) and heavy q-qbar states (dominating in the heavier mesons) emerges.},

We consider the proper time evolution of the effective pion mass, the order parameter {\textlangle}{$\sigma\rangle$}, and the particle number distribution. We examine several different initial conditions and look for instabilities (exponentially growing long wavelength modes) which can lead to the formation of disoriented chiral condensates (DCC's). We find that instabilities exist for proper times which are less than 3 fm/c. We also show that an experimental signature of domain growth is an increase in the low momentum spectrum of outgoing pions when compared to an expansion in thermal equilibrium. In comparison to particle production during a longitudinal expansion, we find that in a spherical expansion the system reaches the "out" regime much faster and more particles get produced. However the size of the unstable region, which is related to the domain size of DCC's, is not enhanced.},

  abstract = {It is thought that a region of pseudo-vacuum, where the chiral order parameter is misaligned from its vacuum orientation in isospin space, might occasionally form in high energy hadronic or nuclear collisions. The possible detection of such disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) would provide useful information about the chiral structure of the QCD vacuum and/or the chiral phase transition of strong interactions at high temperature. We review the theoretical developments concerning the possible DCC formation in high-energy collisions as well as the various experimental searches that have been performed so far. We discuss future prospects for upcoming DCC searches, e.g. in high-energy heavy-ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC.},

This controversy has also been fed by the strong indications that it is not an ordinary quark-antiquark meson. Here we review both the recent and old experimental data and the model independent dispersive formalisms which have provided precise determinations of its mass and width, finally settling the controversy and leading to its new name: \$f\_0(500)\$. We then provide a rather conservative average of the most recent and advanced dispersive determinations of its pole position \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_{\textbackslash}sigma\}=449{\textasciicircum}\{+22\}\_\{-16\}-i(275{\textbackslash}pm12)\$. In addition, after comprehensive introductions, we will review within the modern perspective of effective theories and dispersion theory, its relation to chiral symmetry, unitarization techniques, its quark mass dependence, popular models, as well as the recent strong evidence, obtained from the QCD \$1/N\_c\$ expansion or Regge theory, for its non ordinary nature in terms of quarks and gluons.},

In particular conditions of steady state a new Einstein's field equation is determined in presence of negative curvature. Since GPE governs BECs defects that are useful, analogue models in cosmology, a relativistic form of GPE is also considered to show connection with models of analogue gravity, thus providing further grounds for future investigations of black hole dynamics in cosmology.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, low-pT sector is used to infer the features of initial stages before QGP thermalization. On the other hand, recently acquired wealth of high-pT experimental data paves the way to utilize the high-pT particles energy loss in exploring the initial stages. We here study how four different commonly considered initial-stage scenarios which have the same temperature profile after, but differ in the 'temperature' profile before thermalization affect predictions of high-pT RAA and v2 observables. Contrary to common expectations, we obtain that high-pT v2 is insensitive to the initial stages of medium evolution, being unable to discriminate between different conditions. On the other hand, RAA is sensitive to these conditions, however, within the current errorbars, the sensitivity is not sufficient to distinguish between different initial stages. Moreover, we also reconsider the validity of widely-used procedure of fitting the energy loss parameters, individually for different initial-stage cases, to reproduce the experimentally observed RAA. We here find that previously reported sensitivity of v2 to different initial states is mainly a consequence of the RAA fitting procedure, which may lead to incorrect conclusions. On the other hand, if a global property, in particular the same average temperature, is imposed to tested temperature profiles, high sensitivity of high-pT v2 is again obtained. We however show that this sensitivity would not be a consequence of differences in initial, but rather final, stages. Consequently, the simultaneous study of high-pT RAA and v2, with consistent energy loss parametrization and stringently controlled temperature profiles, is necessary to assess sensitivity of different variables to differences in initial and final stages.},
